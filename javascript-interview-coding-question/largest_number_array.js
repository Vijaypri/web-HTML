// 3. Find the largest number in an array in JavaScript.
// Using a For loop:
// The code defines a function findLargest that finds the largest number in an array. 
// It starts by assuming the first element is the largest, then iterates through the array. 
// If a larger number is found, it updates the largest value. Finally, it returns the largest 
// number which is 100.
